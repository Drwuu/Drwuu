These repositories contains my the projects done for the 42 Common Core. Below is a summary of each project.
## Libft
- Implemented a library of standard C functions.
- Gained a deep understanding of memory allocation, data structures, and basic algorithms.

## Get_Next_Line
- Created a function to read lines from a file descriptor, conforming to 42's "Norm."
- Employed static variables to maintain state between function calls.

## Printf
- Engineered a custom printf function in C to mimic the standard library's printf.
- Implemented format specifiers for integers, strings, characters, and hexadecimal values.
- Enhanced understanding of string manipulation and type casting in C.

## Minitalk
- Built a real-time server-client communication system in C using UNIX signals.
- Developed both server and client components to transmit and receive messages.
- Practiced IPC (Inter-Process Communication) and signal handling.

## Pipex
- Created a program that mimics the UNIX pipeline between two commands using file descriptors.
- Implemented I/O redirection, including input and output to and from files.
- Gained experience in fork-exec-wait process model.

## Push Swap
- Developed a sorting algorithm to sort a stack of integers with a limited set of operations.
- Optimized the algorithm for speed and efficiency, aiming for the least number of operations.
- Used two stacks for sorting and implemented custom sorting algorithms.

## Cub3D
- Created a 3D ray-casting game engine inspired by Wolfenstein 3D.
- Utilized miniLibX to handle graphics rendering.
- Implemented features like wall textures, sprite rendering, and basic collision detection.

## Minishell
- Designed and implemented a simplified UNIX shell in C.
- Utilized system calls to manage processes and implement job control.
- Incorporated features such as command parsing, environment variable handling, and built-in command execution.

## IRC
- Built a multi-client Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server and client in C.
- Implemented features such as channel creation, private messaging, and user authentication.
- Enhanced understanding of socket programming and network protocols.

## CPP Modules
- Completed a series of C++ challenges to learn the fundamentals of the language.
- Worked with Object-Oriented Programming, containers, iterators, and algorithmic methods.
- Deepened understanding of C++ Standard Library and language-specific paradigms.

## Map
- Developed a custom C++ map container similar to std::map.
- Implemented basic operations like insert, find, and erase.
- Practiced balancing trees for optimized data storage and retrieval.

## Inception
- Created a Docker-based architecture to deploy multiple services and applications.
- Focused on containerization, orchestration, and DevOps practices.
- Gained experience in Docker, Docker Compose, and microservices architecture.

## Transcendance
- Developed a web-based social network from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and back-end frameworks.
- Implemented features like user authentication, friend requests, posts, and real-time chat.
- Enhanced skills in full-stack development, database design, and RESTful API construction.
